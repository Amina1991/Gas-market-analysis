Updates of python files are commited in the same file version so that all changes traceable.

The test consisted of three tasks: prepare temperature data, develop the function of profit maximization with the given parameters, and the third one requires to provide the forecast of the given variable. Before the central part, I supply a short instruction if there is a need to check my code. The main findings are described below.

First, I have developed two methods to solve the Task 1 problem in Python. Also, I have described four ways to do that in the most manageable -> advanced order. Given the time constraint, I implemented two medium-advanced methods.

Second, I have developed the demonstrative mechanism in Task 2 explanation.xlsx support file to show Task 2 problem-solving logic. Also, the Python programming technique has been leading in Task 2 explanation.xlsx support file. Finally, I have implemented problem-solving in Python, where the output is the profit-maximizing function.

Third, I have implemented the gas demand forecast for North Carolina in Task 3 in Python. Furthermore, I have done it in the Facebook Prophet package, which I find a great instrument to carry out the given task.

Bonus questions for Task 2 and Task 3 are presented in the last section of Bonus Questions. I have supplied the mechanism description and suggestions on how to realize the propositions.

For Jupyter notebooks from the GitHub repository, please consider that your machine's dataset file name should be the same as in the code. 

By default, codes will work if the original datasets will be in the same folder as the codes themselves. You may change the filePath variable if needed.

Instructions for Task 2
For this task, I also supply the "Task 2 explanation.xlsx" supporting document. I would recommend t take a look at it to understand the result I have given below.

Instructions for Task 3
It may not be easy to proceed with the Jupyter Notebook code, and I would recommend installing it in Anaconda fbprophet 6th version package. It is critical to have this version, not the last 7th one because it has many bugs yet. First, uninstall any system, fbprophet. Then follow the steps below, python.exe -m pip install pystan==2.17.1.0 python.exe -m pip install fbprophet==0.6 python.exe -m pip install --upgrade fbprophet.
